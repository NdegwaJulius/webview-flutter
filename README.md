Webview with flutter

## Getting Started

- With the WebView Flutter plugin you can add a WebView widget to your Android or iOS Flutter app.
- On iOS the WebView widget is backed by a WKWebView, while on Android the WebView widget is backed by a WebView. The plugin can render Flutter widgets over the web view. So for example it's possible to render a drop down menu over the web view.

-React to page load progress events
-Control the WebView through the WebViewController
-Block websites using the NavigationDelegate
